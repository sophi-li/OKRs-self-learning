# OKRs for Self Learning

Sophia's [self learning plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAFmN-UvrFHBYnMRrjpgCKGGjZT1sZnnWI5YfOrw0uo/edit?pli=1#gid=674888816) on launching a career in software engineering, Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) style.

The OKRs methodology is for anyone who wants to set up an ambitious and measurable plan to achieve their goals, any goals. The resources below are for anyone who wants to explore or start a career in software engineering or software development.

Self learning is still (and is always) in progress! This repo is occasionally updated with new resources and learnings.

## What are OKRs?

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a strategic planning tool used by many tech organizations such as Google to establish cross functional team alignment, which ultimately helps move the needle closer to achieving the organization's mission.

**Objectives** are ambitious goals. If your objectives make you feel uncomfortable, that's a sign you're setting up your OKRs with a healthy amount of rigor.

To determine _objectives_, ask yourself, _"Where do you want to go?"_.

**Key results** are measurable and specific milestones that directly contribute to the objective. Key results are outcomes, not activities.

To determine _key results_, ask yourself, _"How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there?"_.

**While OKRs are typically used by organizations for strategic planning to create alignment between teams, I've adapted OKRs for [my own goal setting and tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAFmN-UvrFHBYnMRrjpgCKGGjZT1sZnnWI5YfOrw0uo/edit?pli=1#gid=674888816) for my self learning journey on becoming a software engineer.**

For more information on OKRs, here's [Google's guide on OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/), an easy to read and comprehensive overview of how to create and use OKRs.

## Why use OKRs?

- Focus and accountability over three month increments.
- OKRs are _not_ a task list. When designed right, ambitious OKRs help keep you motivated and track your progress.

## How to use it

Feel free to use [my OKRs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1HAFmN-UvrFHBYnMRrjpgCKGGjZT1sZnnWI5YfOrw0uo/edit?pli=1#gid=0) as a template for your own self study plan.

Steps to determine your Objectives and Key Results:

1. Brainstorm possible objectives, using the question, "Where do you want to go?", as a starting point. Ask yourself "What does wild success look like?" to think big.
2. Narrow down your objectives to 5-6.
3. Brainstorm possible KRs, using the question, "How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there?", as a guide.
4. Narrow down and prioritize KRs that will get you closest to achieving your objective. Aim for no more than 5 KRs per objective.
   - Reminder: KRs are not a to-do list!
5. Get validation and feedback on your OKRs from those who can give constructive and value additive feedback through their own experience or expertise.
6. Get started on crushing your OKRs!
7. Update your OKRs weekly to track your progress.
8. Reflect monthly and adjust OKRs as needed throughout the quarter. OKRs are not set in stone!
9. Do a retrospective at the end of the quarter to apply learning to your next set of OKRs.

## Questions for Coffee Chats

Coffee chats are a great casual way to build your community, learn, and hear first-hand experiences. If you're stuck on what to ask, here are some questions to help get the conversation started:

- What does a day-to-day look like in your role?
- Can I get your feedback on X?
- What are some challenges you face in your work?
- What is something new you are learning right now?
- What are your goals for your career / next career move?
- Do you have advice for a self-taught dev?
- What do you enjoy doing outside of work?
- Can I reach out to you in the near future for feedback on X?
- Question about something specific to them (based off of your research about them / their company)
- Is there anything I can support you in?

Here's a [blog](https://dev.to/sophia_wyl/top-10-tips-for-self-taught-software-engineers-from-20-coffee-chats-23o1) of tips I got from coffee chats.

## Reading List

- [A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout](https://smile.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201/ref=sr_1_3?crid=YXJ3ZLRCTJJG&keywords=philosophy+of+software+design&qid=1567580429&s=gateway&sprefix=philosophy+of+softwa%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-3)

## Projects

Just start building something, _anything_! If you're struggling with projects, start small. This will allow you to build your skills and project size incrementally.

Document your project with a well written readme. [Here's a guide by PurpleBooth](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). This will help recruiters, hiring managers, or anyone looking at your repo quickly understand what your project is and why / how you built it.
